Title:
"The hidden beauty of Pascal's Triangle"

Description:
"In school, we all learn math because it's supposed to be useful. Let's take a look at a different side of mathematics and see what else we can learn from it."

### Introduction
I've been told a lot of times by many of my fellow students that they don't like math, and I can really understand that. In my study programme, anyone who has followed Calculus, Linear Algebra, or Statistics would probably agree that the subjects are pretty tough, very confusing and sometimes just straight-up boring. They are certainly very useful courses, but they are always a means to an end. And students, they learn the material not out of interest, but to pass the course. If a topic is not on the test, most of them wouldn't even care. The focus on useful but complicated mathematics has created a stigma that math just a tool, only to be brought up when absolutely necessary.
I think this is a shame, because there is another side to math, that most people never get to experience. The side that is simple, and yet elegant, the side that can surprise you and make you wonder, the side that you'll never see on a test. It's a side that is best demonstrated by a good example, and I can think of no better example than my favorite piece of math: Pascal's Triangle.

First of all, what is it? Well, Pascal's Triangle is a pyramid, which from the top, stretches infinitely towards the bottom. This pyramid is filled with numbers, but not just any set of numbers. No, we're gonna fill in this pyramid using two rules. Rule number one: the top of the pyramid should be a 1. So, we write a 1 right there. Rule number two: every following number should be the sum of the two numbers above it. So, if we want to find the number that should be in *this* square, and we assume that every number outside the pyramid is a 0, we get 0 plus 1 is 1. We can do the same for the square next to it, 1 plus 0 is 1. With this new layer of numbers, we can find the next layer, which will be 1, 2, 1. And if we continue this, we get an infinite amount of numbers, which don't really seem that interesting on their own. It's only when you know how to look at them, how to draw the lines, how to connect the numbers, that you can fully appreciate how wonderful this triangle actually is. So today, I would like to tell you about three patterns in this triangle, in the hope that you'll be able to look at it in the same way as I do.

### Manhattan Travel
For the first pattern, I would like you to imagine a scenario: you've recently moved to Manhattan, in New York, and you got a new job, which is just a few streets away! As you might know, Manhattan has a very peculiar street plan, where everything is divided into neat rectangles. To get from your appartment to your new office, you just need to walk 4 blocks to the east, and 3 to the south. You could take the same path to work everyday, but you think that's a bit boring. Instead, you decide that you want to take a different path to your work every single day, by following these streets, these arrows, from intersection to intersection. And this might lead you to the question: how many paths are there actually from home to work?
You can, for example, walk 4 times east and then 3 times south, or walk 3 times south and then 4 times east, or take one of the many different paths in between. To count them, you could try to write them all down on a piece of paper. But there's a lot of paths here, how would you know you didn't miss any, or counted one double? And what if your office is even further away than this? You would need a lot more time and paper, more than you can afford. Right now, an efficient solution to this problem seems impossible.

But, there's a trick we can use here, bare with me... If you're only allowed to follow these streets, there's really only two possible crossings through which you can reach your destination: the one to the north of your office and the one to the west. To get to work, you will have to pass exactly one of these two crossings, right? So if you already know the number of paths that lead to those crossings, and you keep in mind that all those paths are just one street away from your destination, you could argue that you can find the answer by just adding those two numbers together. Of course, all we're doing then is move the problem, because now how do we find those two numbers? Well, we can actually move this problem back further and further, until we reach the crossing of our own home. We know for sure that there is exactly one way to reach our home from our home, and that is by staying exactly where we are. And from there, we can finally figure out all of the following numbers and build up this grid, until we can eventually answer our question: the amount of possible ways from home to work is 35.

I hope this process sounded a bit familiar to you, because these numbers, which show the amount of ways to reach a particular crossing from your house, appear just like this in Pascal's Triangle. It's this same set of rules we applied, which suddenly describes in how many ways Manhattaners can walk to work. Isn't that crazy? This triangle, which seemed so pointless at first, actually has a practical use, and all it took to find it, was finding the right way to look at it. Math can pop up in the weirdest places. That's something to keep in mind, the next time you're in New York.

### Fibonacci Series
For the second pattern, I first want to introduce you to something perhaps new. It's called the Fibonacci Series.
It is an infinite row of numbers, which again follows two rules. Rule number one: the series should start with a 0 and a 1. Rule number two: any following number is the sum of the two numbers that came before it. So to continue this series, we start with 0 plus 1 is 1, then we get 1 plus 1 is 2, et cetera. What we get, is an infinite sequence which has many other special properties. The Fibonacci Series is often associated with artistic concepts, because of its ties with nice-looking spirals, patterns in nature, and the Golden Ratio, which during the Renaissance was considered a beauty symbol. The Fibonacci Series is a very interesting concept on its own, but right now, I want to focus on one thing in particular: a special discovery that was made ages ago.

In 1202, someone noticed something interesting about Pascal's Triangle; if you draw lines at a particular angle, each crossing a set of numbers, and you calculate the sum of the numbers on each line, you find the Fibonacci Series, hidden in the triangle. When I first learned about this, I was incredibly surprised. I thought to myself "How is this possible? What kind of coincidence is this?". I have learned, since then, that there is no such thing as coincidence in mathematics; there's a very good reason why this series appears in this triangle. So, let's take a look.
Suppose that we take two lines that are next to each other, and color all the cells that they cross in green and blue. As it turns out, these cells are laid out in such a way, that you can form neighboring pairs of green and blue cells. Since this is of course Pascal's Triangle, the sum of each of these pairs is equal to the number below the pair, the ones colored purple here. And since every purple cell is a green cell plus a blue cell, we could say that "green plus blue equals purple". Now comes the most important part: as some of you may have noticed, these purple cells also lie on one line, and not just any line; the line that comes after the green and the blue line. Since purple is green plus blue, the purple line is the sum of the two lines before it, which sounds exactly the same as Fibonacci's second rule. If this is true for any line, which it is for the same reasons, then it makes sense the Fibonacci Series shows up here.

Following this reasoning, Pascal *contains* Fibonacci, and with that, its reach has extended so much. Pascal apparently appears in spirals, in nature, in Renaissance paintings, due to a very simple proof, that was only discovered centuries after Pascal was first found. Not because it takes a genius to understand it, but because noone knew there was a connection at all. And this could make you wonder: what else did we miss? What crazy connections are still out there, waiting to be discovered?

### Sierpinski Triangle
For the third and final pattern, we are going to look at this triangle from yet another perspective. One day, someone came up with a question: what about odd and even numbers? How are they laid out in this infinite triangle? Could there be a pattern? It's a pointless question, really, there's no practical reason to ask it, but mathematicians are curious, and sometimes curiosity is rewarded.
Here's what we're going to do: we are going to look at a small portion of the triangle, and color every cell that contains an odd number white. If we do that for this triangle here, we see something that looks like the letter "A", which isn't that special on its own. The real pattern however, becomes obvious once we zoom out and see more of it. So instead of 5 layers, let's look at 32 layers of Pascal's Triangle, and see what happens when we do the same as before, when we turn all the cells with odd numbers white...

Wow! Doesn't it look nice?
This seems to be a triangle, made up of three smaller triangles, which are made up of even smaller triangles. The more we zoom out, the more impressive and detailed it looks. This very much seems like a figure called a "fractal", which is basically a special image made using math. This specific fractal is actually a very famous one. It's called the "Sierpinski Triangle", and is considered by many people to be art, just like a painting, because it's simply nice to look at.

### Conclusion
But now I want you to think about something: what do you think is more special about this figure? The way it looks, or the way we found it? Is it just this image that can be called art, or can we also find beauty in the absurd way that we stumbled upon this figure, by simply highlighting the odd numbers of Pascal?
With most art, it's not just about what you see, it's about what it means, the story behind it. The same can be said for mathematics: images like these are nice, but what really makes it special, is the context, the idea behind it, how it works and how it relates to other ideas. That's where the true beauty of this field lies. Math is so much more than just a subject to be studied by aspiring physicists or businessmen. It is the exploration of logical reasoning, to find connections that noone would have ever expected, but which always make so much sense.
Math, though only discovered by humans, is an artform. Not one you can see, hear, taste or feel. It's an artform best enjoyed through careful consideration and centuries of collaboration. Just like with any art movement, whether you like it or not is a subjective matter, and I really do understand that a lot of my fellow students will never share this excitement with me. But after everything you've seen today, I hope that you can all at least agree with me that math is not just a tool, math is art.

Thank you very much!
